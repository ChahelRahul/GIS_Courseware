health geography is a pretty broad field

and it's one that is focused on linking

people place and environment to really

understand how those things shape one

another

so people shape the places that they're

in and the places that people are in

shape who they become as people how they

behave and ultimately their health the

built environment is everything that is

built up around us the buildings the

roads the policies that shape our

communities and so focusing on the built

environment is a natural way to do

health geography and really examine the

relationship between people and place so

the policy location and accessing

community environments research lab or

place where I do my work the name of the

lab is really meant to encompass all the

kinds of things that are important for

understanding that relationship between

people and plays so policies are made by

people in a place to help shape a place

location is talking about why the

settings of where a place actually is

and what it's about are important for

health and access it's really getting at

that notion of equity that we really

need to think about how the things that

are in our environment may or may not be

equally accessible by various kinds of

people and then community environment is

where I focus and community could be a

neighborhood or an organization or a

municipality or province but that it's

that these environments really are the

settings for our health and important

for how we're going to intervene and

improve and enhance the health of our

populations one example that I have of

working with communities that is really

exciting is our current partnerships

with Strathcona County one of the things

we're really excited to work on was the

evaluation of their love to play

innovative preschool space and program

which is really focused on using

unstructured play principles and

environments to enhance social physical

emotional development of small children

for us this was a really interesting and

exciting way to take a new stance on

built environment so moving down from a

community to understanding how the

elements of a classroom impact

preschoolers relative to preschoolers in

other kinds of environments overall I

think my area of research is really

important because it really focuses on

examining the complicated and complex

links between places and the people in

those places and how all of that works

together to impact their health over the

lifespan this is really critical for

Public Health because one thing that we

know works well in public health is the

idea of population health to

intervention which means changing entire

environments to support everyone not

focusing on individual intervention my

name is Candace Nick Fork and this is

public health
