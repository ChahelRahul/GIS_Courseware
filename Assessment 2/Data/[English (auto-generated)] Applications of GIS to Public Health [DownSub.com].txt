hi my name is tim mulrooney i'm speaking

on behalf of rakesh mahultra

and the department of vermont earth and

geospatial sciences to talk about the

applications of geographic information

systems in public health

and how we can use maps and gis to make

informed

and data-driven decisions a lot of times

when we talk about

geography a lot of people associate

geography with something like this

something a question that you'd see

on a show like jeopardy however to us

and to geographers

geography is the study of where biology

is the study of life

sociology is the study of social groups

geography is the study of where

and so geography has a common theme that

involves a spatial extent

and geographers are interested in the

way and perhaps the why that

things and phenomena are laid out and

organized

on the surface of the earth and we

measure that

you can see an example here with cancer

in north carolina

and we can see where cancer rates are

going to be higher

where they're going to be lower now this

isn't a random phenomena

if we were to look at this and see some

type of checkered board pattern we would

see

you know we could show that's random and

that's pretty much a geographer's worst

enemy

but we can look at this and see and

explain perhaps some of the whys and the

where's whether it's access to health

care

environmental factors socioeconomics

that play into these patterns

you can see another example here this is

covered 19 incidence rates at the county

level and this is

early april and so we can see these

patterns to see perhaps where outbreaks

occurred but you can definitely see

where there's high covet incidence rate

surrounded by other high

covet incidence rates and low covet

incidence rates surrounded by other

low covet incidence rates so when we

talk about geography

it means a number of different things

and like i alluded to before

most people associate it with memorizing

countries and capitals

we're learning about different places of

the world and this is typically what we

call

qualitative geography but as we evolve

to more quantitative geography we

actually make

maps and visual products that people can

look at or carry around on their phones

doing gis and spatial analysis and

analyzing geographic data and making

decisions about it which is extremely

important

a lot of times when i give presentations

i ask people

how many of you have used gis typically

i don't get a lot of hands

until i start showing the different

examples here's an example of a running

application that i had on my phone

this is something this is these are

directions that i've used

here i've also just typed in looking for

the banks near me

here here's a weather station that we

have near campus

these are weather maps that we typically

see

here in alamance county i'm looking up a

parcel

and see who owns it and how much it's

worth and the parcel id

here now these days i carry around

a small gps on my wrist and that tracks

where i run and the race that i run and

even biometrics about my heart rate

and then i can go to the i can go to the

look for sex offenders so look for the

sex offender sex offender registry and

look up sex offenders that live near my

house

which is geography or i can look at the

school attendance zones

for my kids school district and so these

are all different applications

of gis so when we talk about gis it's

the computer

the software the hardware the data the

personnel to manipulate analyze present

information that's tied to spatial

location that facilitate

data-driven decisions now gis isn't a

gps

gps is a part of gis it's not as typical

software packages there's a number of

different software packages out there

but nccu has access to a unc license for

a software package called esri arcgis

and arcmap

and it's definitely not a static map

because the second you print out that

static map

it becomes obsolete so these days we

have cloud driven services which

update data on the fly and these maps

that you carry around in your pocket

are always being continuously being

updated

so like we talked about hardware and

software a really small

part part of it so people and the data

in which we make decisions are extremely

important and the procedures which are

always evolving

so when we look at the cost of a gis

over a year a

computer a desktop computer that can

handle gis

may go anywhere from 800 to a couple

thousand dollars the software some of

which is free

up to a few thousand dollars but a gis

analyst your average gis analyst will

make 50 to 60 000

a year starting out your technicians

might make a little bit more

as you evolve up into gis specialists

and programmers and managers

which make definitely more than that so

when we model the actual world we talk

about

gis data we model it using points

lines and polygons now we've all heard

of these before from math class or

geometry class

now instead of calling those locations x

and y

along the axes we call them latitude and

longitude and that's how they're located

so we can measure this using latitudes

and longitudes that substitute for

x and y which have real world locations

so all these points lines and polygons

have real world locations

and points are dimensionless lines are

one dimension and then polygons have two

dimensions meaning

they have area and they have perimeter

so when we model the health portal if we

have something like points this might be

an example like a fatality

an accident a patient or store

a line might be a road or a stream or a

railroad

maybe we're looking at proximity and

polygons could be a lot of things but

polygons

could be what we call enumeration units

where we look at states

or counties or zip codes or census

divisions and within them

we might count the number of incidences

or fatalities

or populations so that we can measure

these and i'll be showing examples of

those

when i show real world gis we also have

something called the raster data model

which is

mosaics of thousands thousands of tiny

pixels that represent 2d

arrays of equally spaced cells it's

typically used to model continuous data

such as density

over space as opposed to individual

units so you might see the location of

you know every single patient right here

which we may or may not be allowed to

use but we can make these types of

heat maps to see where these

concentration or densities of them are

higher

and lower and so when we look at data

versus points versus polygons we can

group these using some simple gis

techniques here's an example of a

student project that we did a few years

ago where

a student wanted to map all premature

heart disease deaths

in durham county look for a relationship

between fast food or something

but we received data from the north

carolina state statistician at the north

carolina department for health

statistics

and we get a map that looks like this

and to a lot of people

it just looks like a bunch of dots to be

honest with you and we could see

where you know they're more concentrated

and where they're less concentrated but

obviously where they're less

concentrated highlights

you know less densely populated areas so

we can group these by say

census block group or census tract and

normalize these

so we can make a map that looks like

this where we can look at the

number of incidences divided by the

number of people and look for some type

of rate and normalize these

and that's getting there so we can turn

a map that looks like this into a map

that looks like

this now there's some other caveats here

here's an example that i've been shown

in my classes for a while

when we apply this to the health

sciences well this is a map of female

age-graded cancer mortality rates now i

just showed an example of rates

but when we talk about you know we know

what female is but

age grading is really important a lot of

times when we look at cancer mortality

rates or any type of rate or mortality

rate

needs to be age graded typically because

what states are going to have the

highest mortality rates it's going to be

where the older populations are

so like west virginia and florida and

arizona where

older populations live so essentially if

you're mapping

mortality rates you're just mapping

where the older people live so

we do a technique called age grading

which standardizes or normalizes the

average age for each county to be the

same and so now when we look at female

age-graded cancer mortality rates you

can see where they're high in the

northeast they're extremely high

the high is in shannon county south

dakota and we talk about some of the

whys behind this

i like to talk to people is that i'm the

gis geek who

essentially i can make the maps and

develop the spatial data infrastructure

to make those happen but

it's a little bit harder to figure out

the why so we rely on maybe sociologists

or biologists or public health

professionals

to figure out the why behind some of

these patterns and i thought it was

interesting the high was in shannon

county south

dakota and about seven about eight years

ago

in 2012 there was a really interesting

national geographic article on the

spirit of crazy horse

uh the rebirth of the sioux nation and i

was looking at some of the statistics

where i saw

you know annual per capita income

poverty rates which were really high

um cirrhosis of the liver rates and

cancer mortality rates which were

many times higher than the average for

the united states i thought this was

really interesting and

in how some of these statistics kind of

play into this

and can affect these and you can see the

poverty rate is almost four times higher

that

than that for the entire united states

and so

is a lot of times we we see some of this

rural blight as well

these are the rates for male age-graded

cancer mortality rates

which highlight and articulate different

patterns where red are the highest rates

greens are the lowest rates

so you can see they're still relatively

high in the northeast but you can see

some of the other patterns along the

mississippi river along the coal belt

right here

here's an example of a student project

where we

we looked at patterns of dui fatalities

across the united states and

we really wanted to articulate the idea

of normalization where that

okay california texas and florida are

going to have high numbers of dui

fatalities

so we normalize these we look at the

number of dui

deaths per 100 000 people and when we

did that we saw that

wyoming was extremely high was about one

and a half times higher

than any other state we kind of had a

couple of hot spots right here

here in the upper you know mountain

region and then in the deep south

and then you can see maybe some of the

religious region reasons might

why they might be low or we're looking

over here at utah and then what are some

of the other reasons why they're high

so i thought this was extremely

interesting map that really articulates

the idea and the need

for normalization as applies to public

health

and then we can look at things within

the environmental sciences

where we look at air quality and maybe

tie these to public health so we look at

you know asthma rates or things like

that so there's a lot of great

interesting data out there part of my

personal specialty has been food

accessibility

and a lot of times low-income

neighborhoods suffer from the brunt of

diseases like diabetes and heart disease

and stroke

and so the usda has devised the term

food desert in an area that's

one more than one mile from a

supermarket and urban area more than 10

miles from a supermarket in rural area

and has a poverty component attached and

we see examples of these all the time i

live over in

in guilford county and on my way to work

i typically see a sign that looks like

this

bring a grocer to gibsonville small

community kind of tucked between

alamance

and and guilford county

but when we look at supermarket

accessibility like i said before this

can be measured across

space and place and we can see areas

in the darkest have the largest distance

to a supermarket and you can see

it's right near the nccu campus so these

are about 67

census block groups in central durham

which was our study area and then

i combine all of these and i look at i

can look at my food desert and so we can

actually go

and use census data to approximate the

number of people

that live within this food desert

and we can make proposals to say if we

were to put

a couple of if we were to put a

supermarket in this location just north

of 147

or this location north of 147 we would

maximize the number of people

who don't live in a food desert anymore

and you see articles to this effect all

the time

and so one of the things that we did is

we did this analysis and we said

okay we could put a story here put a

store here but

right up here what do we see these days

you're driving in

allston street and you see a save a lot

so these people use this analysis

and when i get to the end and talk about

jobs the biggest applications of gis

these days are

retail and business geography and health

geography

another thing that we look at is

convenience store accessibility so we

looked at the same analysis

and you can see these darker areas have

higher distance to a

convenience store these lighter lighter

areas have a lower distance to a

convenience store

and we can make a scatter plot map where

we map just

income versus distance to a convenience

store and we can use statistical methods

to basically talk talk about something

called a line of best fit

and a p score to see what are the

chances that if i were to throw 70

points

up onto this map we would see this

pattern

and the chances are literally zero and

then i can draw something called the

line of best fit where that i see that

as income increases the distance from a

convenience store

also increases and so you can see

these convenience stores are typically

located around

low income areas and not all the time

but our pattern shows that by this

line of best fit and so we have the

slope of the line

and then we have something called a r

squared value that tells you

how close these points are from this

line and these are called residuals

so as we get into health mapping and gis

it's important that

you're good at statistics and then the

gis behind it

now when we try to tie the two together

and this is a project that i've been

personally involved with

with mapping mapping food deserts and

coveted incidents

and this is a map as of halloween

and we can see a map here of covet

incidence rates

at the zip code level and i downloaded

these from the north carolina cova

dashboard

brought them into a gis you can just

download tables bring those into gis

that we work with and we can run

statistics on those

and then we can link and join them to

points lines and polygons and in this

case polygon is using a key

called the zip code that's common in

both of these but you can see where

they're really high and where they're

really low

and so these darkest areas have the

highest covered rates

the lightest areas have the lowest

covered rates

and i superimpose these with food

deserts so these aforementioned food

deserts that we've talked about this is

data that we got from the usda at the

tract level

and so these red areas these red patched

areas

highlight food deserts and i've been

working with a team

and we wanted to see if there was a

relationship between these

and so we took covet incidence rates

at different dates and we looked at the

difference between food deserts and

non-food deserts

and our last uh our last collection date

of halloween to

2020 the covered rates and food deserts

were 265 versus 230.

and we did some independent tests of two

mains and we saw that this was

statistically different it was

statistically different these were

different enough for that we can

make some assumptions about the data

that we couldn't if it was

265 versus 264 or something like that

so we can look at these differences that

highlight statistical significance

between the data

okay and so some of the things that we

want to do is maybe figure out

why what's going on in these high covet

areas

that

that have compromised food security

security or vice versa so it's really

interesting and

try to figure out the why behind these

the other thing we can do is

run cluster statistics because we can

see that they're dark here

but we run clustering with statistical

significance to look for hot spots hot

spots are

high covered rates surrounded by other

high covered rates

versus low covert rates surrounded by

other low covered rates

and i thought it was interesting because

we got this big hot spot that runs in

this u pattern

kind of around moore county around

harnett county around

fort bragg and we got another hot spot

here

over here in charlotte and we can look

at changes in hot spots as well

and this is a map that i've created when

we look at the change in the hot spots

between july 6 which was one of our

collection dates

and september 30th and so you can see

where these hot spots this

you know emergence of this u pattern

occurs and this darkest red basically

shows

where new hot spots have popped up in

september

and these pink were the hot spots that

were still occurred

in july and you can you know most

probably scary is

where we have the new hot spots popping

up but it's also interesting when we

have cold spots popping up so you can

see the spatial relationship and like i

said before

we don't have any checkerboard patterns

here we have things called spatial

outliers

where we see this new hot spot here or a

new cold spot there so what are they

doing whether with regard to testing or

local ordinances or whatever to

facilitate

and perpetuate these patterns and then

we can compare these to

things like long-term health outcomes

like diabetes i'm going to talk about

this in a little bit

but i thought it was interesting when we

had you know low diabetes death rate

here but high covid because

we've uh submitted a paper and some of

the people asked us to look at that and

we really wanted to try to tie that in

now

like i was saying before you've got gis

specific data but we

typically data is going to come in you

know flat files or what we call in gis

standalone files standalone tables which

aren't linked to point line and polygons

and sometimes

health outcomes have an icd code

attached to them and if i go to the

north carolina vital statistics database

i can download a big table that looks

like this

and i can download from the north

carolina vital statistics database

a list of literally everyone who's died

by year

and for 2010 i might have about a

hundred thousand people who

died and it's really interesting because

you can see up at the top here we have

attributes okay so the day the month

the day the year the sex the race how

old they were the cause

the zip code they occurred in so if i

have a zip code i can map it i know what

a zip code looks like it's going to be a

polygon i don't know where exactly in

that zip code that person died

but i can map that like i've done

previously

and so i can pick out some icd codes

that might are

most likely affected by unhealthy eating

habits like

uh acute myocardial infarction chronic

hystamic heart disease

and these are just some of these health

outcomes that might be infected by

but might be impacted by unhealthy

eating habits

and so i can get a big table of these of

everyone who died

of just of these particular causes

and i can download these query these

group these at the zip code

and then i can join these two points

lines and polygons so they're part of my

attribute table that can be mapped

and then i can age grade these so i can

make an

age-graded map of these types of deaths

here

and i can see where they're high and

where they're low

before i age graded moore county had

really high death rates because

it's typically an older population there

in moore county

but when i age grade these you can see

these patterns that

kind of pop up here in scotland and

richmond county as well

just from these particular deaths so i

can turn these tabular files

just lists of people who died into gis

maps fairly easily the other thing that

i've been doing is

looking at food deserts but also food

swamps

because people who live in food deserts

well that might not be that big of a

deal if you live in a rural area i used

to live in an area that was 15 minutes

from

you know the nearest supermarket and

well

lived in a desert but it wasn't a big

deal because i had to drive far

either way to get to food but a food

swamp are going to be areas which have

relatively large amounts of energy dense

you know snack foods

unhealthy food options and so some

recent research has talked about the

over availability as unhealthy food

options

better explained to spirit health

outcomes than just the lack of healthy

food auction

outcomes and i mapped a couple of food

swamps here

in southeastern north carolina in

robeson

cumberland sampson and bladen county i'm

after at the pixel level remember what

pixels were

doing really fine scale analysis then

i'm at them at the block group level and

so you can see these pixels in red

which kind of we brought out but

you can also see these block groups now

block groups are a little bit better

because i have explanatory data

such as income race ethnicity

access to vehicles that are collected

from the census

i don't have the number of people who

live in this

exact area right here at the pixel level

because data aren't collected at that

scale

so there's advantages to this more

coarse data than this finer scale data

and i can count the number of people

that live in this food swamp

and i can start to make some comparisons

so in even in rural food swamps i can

see the percent minority residents

is much much higher in the rural food

swamps

than the best values

i can see the percentage of people

receiving public assistance

and food stamps was much higher and this

is all

information whether it's population

density average household size

poverty components people who vehicles

these are all this is all information

that we can get from the census or

readily available data sources

spending on fruits and vegetables

so to be power to be successful with gis

geography gis earth sciences are growing

fields

and in and with itself geographic

information systems is a powerful

technical skill that you can set you

apart from other applicants

no matter your field so we've had

history education

social work students take our classes

they become used to and comfortable with

working with data in all forms

so to be successful you need an

interested in your particular

skill set and we've done a lot of

application with health mapping

political geography

geology earthquakes lots of different

things out there that we can

map and students have mapped as well

principles of public health and

geography you've got to be

good with computers and managing and

understanding all forms of data and how

these data come about

and then things like math like

percentages and calculations

conversions of units and things like

that so we can age grade and look at

percentages and

be able to make data that makes sense to

us

some other ancillary needs when it comes

to gis problem solving skills

you know writing public speaking maybe a

little bit of computer programming if

you've taken it before

but some of the what i talk about you

know soft skills being able to get along

with others working in teams

group projects things like that because

typically in the workforce you'll be

part of a team that's going to need to

get along with others

but when we talk about careers in gis

there's tons of them demographer working

with data

environmental hazard specialist

environmental scientist a cartographer

someone who makes maps

a gis specialist a transport planner but

like i said before

two of the fastest growing fields are

medical geographer and retail geographer

where are we going to build the next

mcdonald's or where we're going to build

next home depot

what are the patterns of covert rates

these

days and we've seen medical and

geography really hop to the forefront

of gis in terms of their visibility in

the news and media

as well as pay and i've got a couple

examples here of just some gis

jobs and i'll talk about these with with

a public health education slant

but this is a gis analyst and this is if

you look closely enough

this is the people who update the

parcels in this particular county

in flagstaff arizona and so

when you go to uh go to guilford county

or go to durham county

gis website you can look up the parcels

and the parcels you know the actual

parcel that you live on

is maintained on a regular basis we can

download these from the north carolina

one map website and bring these in

make the decisions about these but these

are updated by gis technicians and you

can see the pay

you know forty three to fifty two

thousand dollars to start

here's another one this is a crime

analyst

and you can see here bachelor's degree

required extract working with gis

data arcgis okay

relational databases and queries and

this is in

manassas police station virginia and you

can see the pay for that

now as applied to public health here are

just a couple of them

that i've extracted recently from indeed

this is an outreach coordinator i

thought this was pretty neat

for blue ridge health but you can see

gis cloud mapping and

maybe i alluded to before typically gis

is moving more towards cloud because you

can access the data at any point in time

there's some trade-offs to that and i'll

talk about those when we look at our

a cloud-based application of gis but you

can see

an outreach coordinator they want them

proficient in gis cloud mapping

here's an interesting one i believe this

is in west virginia a gis disaster

recovery instruct

a coordinator provides analysis and gis

mapping resources for repair

preparedness mitigation recovery related

to the coven 19 pandemic

and i thought this was interesting this

is a vaccine data specialist with the

texas department

of state health statistics and so you

can see all of the gis

and data related skills that are

required of it

and you can see the pay for this is a

pretty good pay

now our particular degree is in

environmental and geographic sciences

offered through the department of

mental earth and geospatial sciences

but there's a number of jaw there's a

number of classes here that would be

related to your major

gis 2020 which is an introduction to gis

for non-stem majors geography 3435 which

is geographic information systems where

we

introduce uh students using web-based

and the software applications the

software application's a little bit more

robust

so for people who want to use gis in

their work and research

then we have geography 4010 which is

applied gis which focuses on the

development creation of data

on both computers in the cloud and then

we have geospatial statistics that focus

on the management of data

and application of statistical methods

to geographic data

and so in geography 3435 and 4010

you'd probably be able to make a map

like this

when we look at geospatial statistics we

understand the concepts that

make this so we talk about what's the

definition of a neighborhood what's a

cluster

we typically let the computer handle

these but how we interpret these

we also have a nga certification this is

the national geospatial intelligence

agency

certified program that helped fast-track

to careers in the intelligence field

so north carolina central is one of

about 17 or 18

ngi nga certified programs across the

united states

and we have two nga certified

instructors and so when we talk about

well how does geospatial intelligence

relate to health and i thought this was

a pretty neat example how we use geo

intelligence to access for health and

humanitarian work in the global south a

lot of times we hear the term

climate refugees so people who are

leaving

one place to go to another place and how

that changed the dynamics of these areas

also health refugees

some of the success stories that we've

had recently include

this is a richard mata murray he did

work on food deserts and food access in

southeastern north carolina and he

interned at esri charlotte

esri is the people who make our gis

software but he now works as a business

and market strategy analyst for lowe's

down in charlotte uh hiley she graduated

for bs in environmental science

she interned at nascar and ups in

sustainability and

she works out in hawaii in the office of

sustainability

and climate change in honolulu hawaii

so here are a couple of gis resources

we've got a youtube page

we you know introduce tutorials that i

utilize in my classes

was as well as some of our happenings

that we have when we talk about gis for

the health science first of all we need

to remember

everything spatial in nature all

phenomena exhibit some pattern

at different scales at the county scale

or zip code scale or national scale

and that quantitative data and analysis

through statistics and spatial

statistics

is important in determining patterns and

correlations

and then we want to see if patterns have

a unifying theme whether it's a school

ascending district is it near extreme

air quality as well as other indicators

because there's a lot of reasons why

these patterns occur

now this is my information here

feel free to reach out to me if you have

any questions but what i did want to

show

is just a couple of applications of gis

data and i have some gis data here in

the cloud

this is an application that we made

using something called arcgis online

and this is these coven maps that i

showed before

at the at the zip code level

and i can click on this little button

here and all of these data are stored

in the cloud okay so they're stored in

the cloud so they're

not sitting on my computer right now so

i can check and uncheck these and

i can move these around that i've added

these things called widgets

okay so that i can measure distances

right here

but when we actually look at the nature

of gis

data i can click on these census tracts

and

i can click on these zip codes okay and

there's something called an attribute

table so when i look at these

this is the actual attributes that

run the points lines and polygons

and so since it's stored in the cloud it

takes a little bit longer

to render here but i've got the name of

my zip code the population

covered rates the median household

income and these are

these have been some data that i've been

collecting as part of a project

whether it's in a usda food desert some

of the food environment indicators

but some of the interesting things here

is that these points lines and polygons

in this case

polygons are linked to

spatial features so i clicked on belmont

right here

and then you can see that it's

highlighted in the map

okay and this is truly which

differentiates

gis data from your truly statistical

analysis and so this is an example of it

you know how it's stored in the cloud

how it's

stored in the cloud these are web

mapping applications using something

called

arcgis online that i can display

i can run things called filters and do a

number of different things here to

render these

now the other types of data that i have

here other types of application are

desktop applications

a little bit more robust because the

data is sitting on your computer

sitting on a server that's a little more

easily accessible

so data sitting on the cloud is a little

bit harder to access because it's in the

cloud it takes a little bit longer to

render

but you can see applications that i have

here now this is called

arcmap and there's a new application

coming out called arcgis pro they're the

exact same thing over in the left here

they have have a table of contents that

i can check and uncheck things

and i have these maps the thing about

arcgis pro is that it's evolving and

it's got that ribbon

it has this ribbon that we're getting

used to with your typical office

application so arcgis and the people who

make arcgis

are moving in that direction so i can

change the you know change the

appearance and the symbology of

everything and

these will these will pop up so if i

click on map right here my feature layer

will

disappear because it's not going to be

applicable here

but we have a couple of different

applications here this is one

and uh this is arcmap which is it was

basically being depreciated deprecated

and so i have a couple of maps right

here this is a cluster map that i've

shown before

but i can run things like queries and so

i can go to something like selection by

attributes or i can look for

selection by location i want to find all

the zip codes

in this particular area so i can look

for all the counties

in this case maybe i can look for all

the zip codes

where the covert rate is

greater than 400

and i can click apply

and now we can look for the covert rates

where they're extremely high or

extremely low

okay so we can run some of these queries

here

and i can open up the attribute table

here as well

and you can see the attributes attached

to these and i can run things like

statistics so i can right mouse click

summarize

in statistics i can look at is it in a

usda

food desert what is the total population

you can see some of the data that i've

been collecting as a result of this

i can see the the covered rates right

here so i can sort the covert rates from

highest to lowest i can do sort as

sending sort descending

so i can see oh here's some covert rates

that are 819

all the way down to some data which i

don't have i can look for associations

between

my diabetes rates at the zip code level

covered rates for 930 so i can do some

things like

change detection look at you know

poverty rates percent minority

green space other things that we've been

looking at and trying to associate with

these

so in conclusion this is an example of

some of my gis data that i have out

there

and like i said before we can run our

geospatial statistics where i

i can group whether it's you know income

or race or in this case diabetes

in this case covert rates with these so

i hope this is a good and

comprehensive good and good introduction

to gis and how it can be

used and applied to

public health and please let me know if

you have any questions
